# 🎉 Mini Project: Image Classification Model 🎉

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed my mini project! 🚀🤖

## 📸 Image Classification Model
This project focuses on building an image classification model using machine learning. The model is trained to recognize and identify legendary sports personalities. 🌟

## 🏆 Sports Personalities
The dataset consists of images of **5 legendary sports personalities**.

## 🧠 Training Process
The model underwent rigorous training, learning to distinguish between different sports stars based on the provided images. 🤓

## 🎯 Drag & Drop Functionality
The fun part is the interactive drag-and-drop feature! By dragging and dropping an image from the dataset, the model identifies the corresponding sports personality. ⚡

## 🔍 Features
- **Image Classification**: The model can identify which sports personality is in the image.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple drag-and-drop mechanism makes it easy to test the model.

## 📽️ Demo
Here’s a sample screen recording showing the model in action. [Link to demo video]

## 👀 Can You Guess?
Try testing the model yourself—see if it recognizes your favorite sports icon! 🤔
